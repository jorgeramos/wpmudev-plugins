# WPMU DEV Plugins

This repository is for my own reference for including [WPMU DEV plugins](https://premium.wpmudev.org/projects/category/plugins/) on personal WordPress projects managed via composer. An active WPMU DEV membership is required for authentication.

For more information on how to use composer with WPMU DEV plugins, see [Installing WPMU DEV Plugins via Composer](https://premium.wpmudev.org/docs/getting-started/installing-wpmu-dev-plugins-via-composer/).
